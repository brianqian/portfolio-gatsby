Babl is a real-time messaging application, very similar to another project, Websocket.io in concept. The main difference being this project has a translation layer on top that lets users communicate to each other in their own preferred language. User logins are persisted through JWT authentication backed by a Mongo Atlas instance.

- Messaging
- Database structure/controllers
- Websocket integration
- Route Design
- Read notifications
- Typing notifications
- Backend Authentication
- Local front end state management
- General architecture / data flow
  <br></br>

Additionally this application supports the following:

- Translation
- Material-UI design
- User Avatars hosted on AWS
- Friend request/invites via email or link
