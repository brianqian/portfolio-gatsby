This is a React/Redux calculator app for the nSuns workout program. After entering in a max lift, the calculator generates a workout plan based off the nSuns linear progression model. Users can also choose from a range of pre-built accessory plans or create custom ones that are retained after creating an account.
<br></br>
Features also include a rest timer, metric support, and different variations of the nSuns program. The app uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to persist user authorization and bcrypt for password hashing.
