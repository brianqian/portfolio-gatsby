Websocket.io is a real-time chat application using the Websocket API. It started as a simple project to just learn Websocket technology but I decided to use this project to learn Typescript, Webpack, and Babel. Since this was intended to be small all DOM manipulation is in vanilla Javascript with plans to further refactor into React.
